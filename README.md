## 1) Background

Our genetic information is stored in a repeating sequence of nucleotides, abbreviated by the letters A, C, G, T in DNA, and A, C, G, U in RNA. Oligonucleotides are short DNA or RNA oligomers between 20 and 60 units in length. However, they rarely exceed 200 nucleotides. They can be synthesized or found naturally as single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) fragments of DNA or RNA. Oligonucleotides (or oligos) have many uses, from research to disease diagnosis and, recently therapeutics.

The last few decades have witnessed an explosion of knowledge in molecular biology. It is increasingly evident that evolution has generated an astonishingly complex set of interconnected processes through which gene expression can be regulated. One such process that has evolved due to wide availability of inexpensive synthetic single-stranded DNA and RNA is routine DNA amplification by PCR primers. It has revolutionized the study of gene expression and disease processes via a range of processes, including RNAi, target degradation by RNase H-mediated cleavage, splicing modulation, non-coding RNA inhibition, gene activation and programmed gene editing. In addition to the use of Oligonucleotides as PCR primers, they are also used as probes, in microarray, in situ hybridization, antisense analyses, and even as drug carriers.

Such new findings about varied applications of Oligonucleotides typically first appear in the scientific literature and is then later manually curated into biomedical databases, such as [WormBase](https://wormbase.org//#012-34-5) where the information is presented in a standardized, queryable format. This process of manual curation by identifying and extracting Oligonucleotides is expensive, time-consuming, captures a small part of the relevant literature and therefore is a significant challenge in advancing precision medicine and gene expression.

Another curation method is automated information extraction, which uses text mining and biomedical natural language processing (aka BioNLP) techniques to assist in acquiring and managing this knowledge. However, it is found that previous efforts/developments in biomedical automated text mining have focused primarily upon named entity recognition of well-defined molecular objects such as genetic variations and mutations. Less work has been performed to identify entities like oligonucleotides, which in recent years have become crucial in biomedical research and practical applications. Another limitation of this method is its inability to efficiently scale to minimize manual efforts and still curate a constantly expanding corpus of literature with high accuracy.

## 2) Objective of OligoFinder

To solve the above-stated problem, we present an accurate, efficient, scalable and fully/semi-automated curation system called **OligoFinder** for identifying and extracting Oligonucleotide mentions along with related data. Such a system will be used by Biomedical researchers to understand from a research paper the type of experiment in which a particular oligonucleotide sequence is used, to understand the target used in that experiment along with that particular oligonucleotide and to study the structure of that particular oligonucleotide. 

The objectives for this system are:-
- designing **pipeline for identifying and extracting oligonucleotide mentions** from research papers along with related data like **oligonucleotide names** and placing all this data in a CSV format file.
- building a **pipeline to auto-curate extracted sequences to be True positive oligonucleotide mentions or False positive** by use of BOWs. Its need arose as many extracted sequences follow structural patterns that of an oligonucleotide but were actually gene expressions, mutations, variations, etc. Thus to reduce efforts to manual curate and tag sequences as TP or FP, we need such type of auto curating pipeline.
- engineering a **pipeline for automatic advancement/improvisation of BOWs** based on manual curations in CSV containing oligonucleotide and other related data. 
- developing **CSV-based system to allow easy manual curation** of a dataset by taking into account previous manually curated tags and relevant auto-tags of sequences being TP or FP.
- preparing a **high-quality gold standard dataset of oligonucleotide mentions** across various biomedical research papers for researchers to take reference for experiments and to validate the performance of oligonucleotide extraction systems that will come up in the near future.
- coding a **matrix for judging the performance of the oligonucleotide extraction system and Bag of Words** (used for auto-curating the sentences).

## 3) Work overview

Please note that many modifications made in the features of this system were directly committed to the main branch as they are well tested and hold more straightforward logic and code blocks. Developments and modifications made in the significant features of this system were committed in the form of Pull Requests (PRs), which you can view below.

#### 3.1) Implementation of pipeline to extract text from research papers
  - Directly commited to the main branch
  - Overview -
    - Created `get_paper_content.py` script, which via `textpresso.py` script extracts content from a research paper(s) in Wormbase corresponding to id(s) present in the `configure.py` file.

#### 3.2) Implementation of RegEx rules (present inside `RegexRules`) folder for extracting sequences following structure of Oligonucletides

  - Link to the PR - [#4](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/4), [#5](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/6/files)
  - Overview -
    - Created Regex rules `bw_brackets.py`, `check_alpha_num_specialchk.py`, `combine_oligo_parts.py`, `combine_rules.py` (earlier named as regex_extraction.py) 
    - Created `oligo_extract.py` script, which gets a text from a research paper(s), extracts sequences similar in structure to Oligonucleotide and returns data in a CSV format.

#### 3.3) Optimizing RegEx rules (present inside `RegexRules`) folder that extracts sequences following structure of Oligonucletides

  - Link to the PR - [#8](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/8/files), [#11](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/11/files)
  - Overview -
    - Optimized the logic used in `combine_oligo_parts.py` and `combine_rules.py` (earlier named regex_extraction.py) scripts to resolve the issue of incomplete extracted sequences.
    - Optimized the logic used in `combine_oligo_parts.py` `combine_rules.py` (earlier named regex_extraction.py) scripts to bring down False Positive sequences by not considering too short sequences, which often turn to be mutations, gene expression, etc. 

#### 3.4) Implementation of script to create BOWs

  - Link to the PR - [#10](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/10/files), [#13](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/13/files)
  - Overview -
    - Created `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py` script (formerly known as csv_reader.py) that uses manual curations made in the CSV (output by `oligo_extract.py` file) to generate two BOWs using the TF-IDF technique. One comprises words corresponding to oligo sequences, and another comprises words corresponding to non-oligo sequences. 

#### 3.5) Implementation of script to use BOWs for auto-labelling/curating sentences as True positive or False positive oligonucleotide sequences

  - Link to the PR - [#12](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/12/files), [#15](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/15/files)
  - Overview -
    - Created the `TfIdf_BOW_TpFp.py` script that works along with the `oligo_extract.py` script. `TfIdf_BOW_TpFp.py` script gets each sentence (of the extracted text) as an input from the `oligo_extract.py` script and uses BOWs (generated by the `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py` script) for auto-labelling/curating sentences as True positive or False positive oligonucleotide sequences.  
    
#### 3.6) Optimizing system's code to get input from user at a single place 

  - Link to the PR - [#16](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/16/files)
  - Overview -
     - Created `configure.py` script so that the user needs to input all arguments/variables at a single place and just for a single time unless needed to be changed. This reduces the extra hassle of passing inputs in the command line while running some file, which often gets skipped from the user's mind. 
     - Made corresponding changes in files like `oligo_extract.py` (it needs ids of papers in the Wormbase database from which the user wants to churn out oligo sequences and related data, and then it outputs this extracted data in the form of a CSV file in the location defined in `configure.py` file. It also needs credentials present in `all_config.cfg` to access these papers from Wormbase), `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py` (it needs the path of the CSV output by `oligo_extract.py` as an input to output two BOWs in locations defined in `configure.py` file) and `TfIdf_BOW_TpFp.py` (it needs paths of the two BOWs output by `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py` as an input to auto-curate the CSV).
    
#### 3.7) Implementation of script to automate BOW expansion 

  - Link to the PR - [#18](https://github.com/malayjoshi13/GSoC2022_OligoFinder/pull/18)
  - Overview -
    - Created `extraction_and_BOW.py` (formerly extract_BOW.py) script that will run BOW creator script, Oligo extraction script and True positive/False positive auto marking script one after another in a continuous manner till the time Oligo extraction script and BOW becomes so smart that the number of True positive oligo sequences is much higher than the number of False positive oligo sequences.
    - How does this cyclic pipeline work? Firstly, the curator manually labels the sentences using BOWs as True positive oligo sequences or False positive oligo sequences. This curation is turned into BOWs which then, in the second round of running the `extraction_and_BOW.py` script, auto-tags the sentences in a column separate from the one which the curator marked in the first round. Then in this second round, the curator again manually marks newer sequences as true positive or false positive and also takes reference from the auto-tags (done by BOWs) for curating these newer sequences. Once curation is done, the `extraction_and_BOW.py` script is run for the third time where again, BOWs (which got updated from curations of round 2) firstly auto-tags sequences and then curator manually tags and also take reference from sequences which BOWs have auto-tagged. 
    - This is how this cyclic pipeline controlled by running of `extraction_and_BOW.py` script after every manual curation, helps to improvise BOWs to be used in the next cycle, tells how smart BOW has become and tells how many True positives have increased in the final corpus.

#### 4.1) Part of system for setting up and initiating setup

- `Setup` - stores the` config_readme.md` file containing credentials to access research papers from the Wormbase database via Textpresso and the `requirements.txt` file for setting up the development environment.

- `configure.py` - comprise of following parameters:-
  
  - `paper_ids` - from this parameter, user can add research paper ids (present in Wormbase) from which they want to extract oligonucleotide mentions,     
  - `output_CSVname` - from this parameter, the user can change the location of the CSV containing extracted oligonucleotide mention along with other related objects. This file is output by `oligo_extract.py` and is input for `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py`,
  
  - `oligo_BOW_filename` and `non_oligo_BOW_filename` - from this parameter user can change location of txt files containing BOW related to oligonucleotide and non-oligonucleotide mentions respectively. These files are output by `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py` and input for `TfIdf_BOW_TpFp.py` file

#### 4.2) Part of system for getting text from research paper(s)

- `RawText` - stores `textpresso.py` and `get_paper_content.py` files that extract content from research papers in the Wormbase database corresponding to their id mentioned in the `paper_ids` parameter of the `configure.py` file and returns a pair of paper id-sentence.

#### 4.3) Part of system having RegEx rules to extract sequences that follow structure of Oligonucleotides

- `bw_brackets.py` - contain RegEx rule `pick_from_brackets` that extracts Oligonucleotide sequence if present inside brackets. Input: insert(TGAGACGTCAACAATATGG)hg, Output: TGAGACGTCAACAATATGG.

- `check_alpha_num_specialchk.py` - contain three RegEx rules: 
  - `has_acgt` - this RegEx rule checks if the input word follows the structure of an Oligonucleotide or not. If the input word contains only alphabetic characters like A, a, C, c, G, g, T and T, then that word follows the structure of an Oligonucleotide; otherwise not. Input1: TGAGACGTCAACAATATGG, Output1: TGAGACGTCAACAATATGG and Input2: TXxvFDECAAOpJHTGG, Outpu2: None.
  -  `has_35` - this RegEx rule checks if the input word follows the structure of an Oligonucleotide or not. If the input word contains only numeric characters like 3 and 5 or does not have any numeric characters, then that word follows the structure of an Oligonucleotide; otherwise not. Input1: 3'-TGAGACGTCAACAATATGG-5', Output1: 3'-TGAGACGTCAACAATATGG-5' and Input2: TGAGACGTCAACAATATGG, Outpu2: TGAGACGTCAACAATATGG and Input3: 3'-TGAGA2CGT3CAACAATATG675G-5', Output3: None. 
  -  `remove_special_characters` - except alphabetic characters ranging from A to Z and a to z, remove every other character from the input word like numeric values (3, 5, etc.), special characters (,./?"':}{][, etc) and extra spacings.

- `combine_oligo_parts.py` - contain two RegEx rules:
  - `is_part` - this RegEx rule combines back Oligonucleotide sequences that are actually part of a single oligo sequence but are treated like individual oligo sequences due to spaces, newline, etc. Input: TT GCA ATG CGAAAATAC, Output: TTGCAATGCGAAAATAC.
  - `only_regex` - outputs a list of words that satisfies all structural rules of an Oligonucleotide and thus are called 'sequences' from now onwards.
  
- `combine_rules.py` - contain two RegEx rules:
  - `word_processor` - pass input word through four RegEx rules namely `pick_from_brackets`, `has_acgt`, `has_35`and `remove_special_characters` (all four mentioned above), and returns the ouput processed word.
  - `oligo_seq_regex` - output of `word_processor` rule becomes input for this which is passed to two RegEx rules namely `is_part` and `only_regex`. The output from this is a sequence that follows an Oligonucleotide's structural composition.

- `oligo_extract.py` - compiles extracted oligos (from research paper(s)), along with paper id, auto & manual true positive/false positive tags, previous, current (from which oligo sequence is extracted) & future sentences into a Pandas data frame which is saved as a CSV file.

#### 4.4) Part of system for creation and usage of BOWs 
- `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py` - uses 'TP or FP Oligo (manual)' column of CSV generated above (which has manual curations + auto curations which curator felt to be right) to generate two Bag of Words (BOW) having higher TF-IDF scores. 

  - First BOW has words related to sentences that have tag of containing "oligo" in the 'TP or FP Oligo (manual)' column. Second BOW has words related to sentences that have tag of containing "non-oligo", "other", "mutation", etc in the 'TP or FP Oligo (manual)' column of CSV genertaed.

- `TfIdf_BOW_TpFp.py` - uses BOWs generated above to auto-curate sentences in the upcoming output CSV to be a TP oligo or FP oligo.

- `sentence_processor.py` - process the words and adds only english dictionary words in the BOWs.  

#### 4.5) Part of system that builds a cyclic pipeline between Oligo extraction script and BOWs creation & usage script
- `extraction_and_BOW.py` - script that will run BOW creator script, Oligo extraction script and True positive/False positive auto marking script one after another in a continous manner till the time Oligo extraction script and BOW becomes so smart that number of True positive oligo sequences is high as a pre-defined number.

## 5) Usage

### 5.1) Install

- Create a virtual environment named "extractor" (only once):

  `python3 -m venv extractor`

- Activate the virtual environment each time:

  `source extractor/bin/activate`

- Install dependencies (only once):
  
  `cd Setup`
  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
### 5.2) Configure credentials and set parameters

Go to `Setup` folder (in your cloned GitHub repository) and there create `all_config.cfg` file as per the instructions mentioned in the README.md of `utils` folder. 

Now within `Setup` folder, go to `configure.py` and there user can perform following actions:

a) `paper_ids` - can add research paper ids present in Wormbase from which you wanr to extract oligonuclotide mentions. By default Wormbase ids of a set of `100 research papers` are taken for extracting oligonucleotides from them.

b) `output_CSVname` - can change location of CSV containing extracted oligonucleotide mentions along with other related objects. This file is output by `oligo_extract.py` and is input for `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py`. By default CSV of name `oligo_test.csv` will be created and accessed from the base directory location.

c) `oligo_BOW_filename` and `non_oligo_BOW_filename` - can change location of txt files containing BOW related to oligonucleotide and non-oligonucleotide mentions respectively. These files are output by `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py` file and input for `TfIdf_BOW_TpFp.py` file. By default BOWs named `oligo_BOW.txt` and `non_oligo_BOW.txt` will be created and accessed from the base directory location.

### 5.3) Execution

Extract oligonucleotides from research papers and use as well as enhance BOWs:

`cd ..`

`python extraction_and_BOW.py`

## 6) Data Flow Diagram

Currently, this system is divided into majorly two halves. In the first half, find and extract sequences that have conventional Oligonucleotides' structure into a CSV file. Another half first uses manual curations by the curator (who tags the sequences present in the CSV file to be an Oligonucleotide [True positive] or not an Oligonucleotide but has the same structure that an Oligonucleotide has [False positive]) to generate a Bag of Words (aka BOW) corresponding to words related to oligo sequences and non-oligo sequences in sentences. These BOWs are then used in the next/upcoming cycle to auto-label oligo sequences to be true positive or false positive (the idea behind using BOWs to auto-curate is that the pattern/words which are present in sentences with oligos or non-oligos will be first taken out and then used in future for auto-labelling as the presence of unique words from BOWs directly points towards a sequence to be an oligo or not).  

When the oligo extraction script runs on more and more research papers, it finds more sequences that need to be manually curated for the first time and then auto-curation by use of BOW (which reduces this manually curation to semi-manual curation work). These curated sentences and oligo sentences further improvise the existing BOWs by adding more words, thus widening the scope to include every possible word related to an oligo/non-oligo sequence. Again this improvised BOW will reduce the need for manual curation and will be able to differentiate better between oligo and non-oligo sequences, thus increasing True Positive and reducing False Positive oligo sequences.

This cycling pipeline comprising of processes of extraction of oligonucleotide mentions from papers, auto-curation by BOWs, manual curation by curator and creation/extension of BOWs is run multiple times so that in the end, oligo extraction script and BOWs will become so much smart to produce a large corpus of True positive oligos that, in future will be used along with RegEx (what we are currently using) and BioBERT (trained on large oligo corpus mentioned above) based oligo extraction script to generate high True positives out of any given research paper. 

### Case 1 (User for first time is using this project i.e. there is no CSV and BOWs with him/her as of now) 
- When the user runs the command `python extraction_and_BOW.py`, then as initially no CSV (containing extracted oligo sequences and curations) is present, it means BOWs (corresponding to oligos and non-oligos sequences) cannot be created as of now (because BOWs are created using the manual curations by the curator in the CSV). 
- Absence of BOWs further indicates that auto labelling of sequences (True positive oligo or False positive oligo) also needs to be skipped. 
- Therefore, as a result, only the `find_Oligos` function of the `oligo_extract.py` file will be used to extract oligonucleotides and return them in a CSV format along with other pieces of information like paper id, empty auto & manual true positive/false positive tags' columns, previous, current (from which oligo sequences are extracted) & future sentences.

### Case 2 (User has already once used this project over few papers i.e. there is a CSV with him/her and BOWs if that CSV has been curated else no BOWs [because BOW is created using manual curation in the CSV, which is empty right now] and now again using it on new research papers)
- For the first sub-scenario where BOWs are empty (as CSV is still not curated), there will be no TP-FP auto curation available; thus, even after the first time, the curator has to curate every time manually). So, let us ignore this case as the curator, anyhow, at some point in time has to curate the CSV if he/she wants auto-curation.
- Focusing on the second sub-scenario where BOWs are not empty (as the curator did the initial manual curation on the CSV generated using the `find_Oligos` function of `oligo_extract.py` called when the user runs command `python extraction_and_BOW.py` in the CMD), there in the second cycle, using the manual curations of CSV, BOWs are created via `create_BOW` function of `TfIdf_BOW_creator.py` when the user runs runs command `python extraction_and_BOW.py`. Note that BOWs are created before oligos get extracted via the `oligo_extract.py` script. Furthermore, for each round, as we assume the system is running on new research papers along with currently listed papers, there will be new oligo sequences and already existing sequences in each cycle. 
  - Now, these BOWs in the second round will auto-curate the new oligo sequences in the output CSV (as in the second round, only non-empty BOW has come into existence) via the `TfIdf_BOW_TpFp.py` file called when user runs command `python extraction_and_BOW.py`. Note that this auto-curation will happen after oligo extraction and BOWs creation happens. However, this auto-curation in starting stages will not be that efficient but will act as a good help for reducing even some manual curation work. These BOWs have a scope to be improvised in the near future.
  - Now curator uses the above-generated auto-curation (auto-curation which he/she feels to be correct) along with his/her manual curation to curate and label newly generated oligo sequences as true positive or false positive. In addition, he/she uses old tags for already present sequences (from previous papers).
  - These manual curations + old verified tag + new curator verified auto-tags (all present in the 'TP or FP Oligo (manual)' column of CSV) would improvise the existing BOWs. 
  - The process continues, and new oligo sequences will be extracted, auto-tagged by improvised BOWs (from the previous cycle), manually curated by the curator + use of auto-tags verified by the curator and again, these tags will improvise the existing BOWs. 

- Thus, in short 
  - manual curation + curator verified auto-tags improvise BOWs to be used in the next cycle, 
  - comparison between auto-tags and manual tags in each cycle tells how smart BOW has become because the larger number of auto-taggings BOW can do, shows its higher performance, 
  - analysis of each cycle's manual tags tells how many True positives have increased due to better BOWs and oligo extraction script. It also tells where the oligo extraction script can be further improvised.

## 7) Future work

Lots of development and implementation, planned before the start of the GSoC'22 coding period, have been achieved. Continuing ahead, I and mentors of this project have proposed a few more features and pipelines to be added to this ambitious project to improvise it further. These proposed plans are as follows:
- optimizing RegEx rules to resolve over-joint sequences issue.
- creating a matrix to analyze at what rate True positive oligonucleotide sequences are increasing compared to total and False positive extracted oligonucleotide sequences. Such analysis indicates how much smarter oligo extraction script and BOWs have become after multiple rounds of running the `extraction_and_BOW.py` script along with manual + auto curation.
- to train the BioBERT model on a corpus of True positive oligonucleotides by using the self-training method. Using trained BioeBERT along with Regex rules will extract more True positive oligo mentions from research papers.
- creating a pipeline to find and output oligonucleotide names in a separate new column of the same CSV, which is currently getting output from the `oligo_extract.py` script.
